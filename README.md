# List-Library

A static C library that implements a singly linked list and various functions
to manipulate those lists with the following functions:

- Add a node to front of list with addFront().
- Traverse nodes in list with traverseList(). 
- Flip the signs of a void data pointer in a node with flipSignDouble().
- Compare the data stored in a node containing double data types in compareDouble().
- Search the list with findNode()
- remove the "first" node in the list with popFront()
- Add a node after a specified node in the list with addAfter().
- Reverse nodes in the list with reverseList().
